/**
 * @brief Header file for define the project's configuration variables procedurally, so they
 *        can be included and used later in the source code.
 * 
 *        The data that initializes the constant evaluated expresions are just placeholders that
 *        will be parsed and filled by CMake at build time. This configuration file later will be
 *        copied to a concrete location in the build folder, and converted into a real CPP header 
 * @file config.hpp.in
